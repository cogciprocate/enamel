enamel
======

[![](http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/enamel)](https://crates.io/crates/enamel)

*A pretty coating to protect the Rust inside.*

An OpenGL&trade; interface overlay library for use with [Glium].

This project is in very early stages but buttons and textboxes work just fine.

## Usage

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
enamel = "0.1"
```

See [examples] for usage. Obviously documentation is sparse but there should
be some rustdoc up eventually.
