*A pretty coating to protect the Rust inside.*

An OpenGL&trade; interface overlay library for use with
[Glium](https://github.com/tomaka/glium).

This project is in a very early stage but buttons and textboxes work just
fine.

See examples for usage. Obviously documentation is very sparse but there
should be some rustdoc up soon.
